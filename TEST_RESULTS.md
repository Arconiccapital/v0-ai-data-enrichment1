# Attachment Feature - Test Results

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### Security & Configuration Fixes:
1. ✅ **Removed invalid Next.js 15 config** - The `export const config` pattern was removed from the upload route
2. ✅ **Added .gitignore entries** - Both `/public/uploads/` and `/.uploads/` are now excluded from git
3. ✅ **Secured file storage** - Files now stored in `.uploads/` directory outside public folder
4. ✅ **UUID package verified** - Already installed (version 11.1.0)

### Functional Improvements:
5. ✅ **File deletion implemented** - Files are now deleted from disk when attachments are removed
6. ✅ **Context length management** - Smart truncation to prevent token limit issues:
   - Max 8000 characters total context
   - Distributes space evenly across multiple documents
   - Preserves beginning of each document for context

## How to Test

1. **Start the dev server** (already running)
2. **Navigate to** http://localhost:3000
3. **Upload the test CSV**: Use `test-data.csv` provided
4. **Add attachment to a column**:
   - Right-click on "CEO" column header
   - Select "Manage Attachments"
   - Upload `test-attachment-companies.txt` 
   - Toggle "Use attachments as enrichment context" ON
5. **Enrich the column**:
   - Right-click the CEO column again
   - Select "Enrich Column"
   - Enter prompt: "Find the CEO name"
   - Watch as it uses both web search AND attachment data

## Expected Results

The CEO column should populate with:
- Apple Inc → Tim Cook
- Microsoft Corporation → Satya Nadella
- Amazon.com Inc → Andy Jassy
- Google LLC → Sundar Pichai
- Tesla Inc → Elon Musk

## Security Notes

- Files are stored securely in `.uploads/` (not publicly accessible)
- File paths are validated before deletion to prevent directory traversal
- Upload size still limited by Next.js defaults (around 4MB without config)

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Use cloud storage (S3, GCS) instead of local filesystem
2. Implement proper authentication for file access
3. Add virus scanning for uploaded files
4. Set up proper backup and retention policies
5. Consider CDN for frequently accessed documents
